#### I tried out Microsoft Timeline Storyteller. 
https://timelinestoryteller.com/

Once you upload your data, it'll let you quickly change the
* chart view (linear, spiral, grid)
* scale (chronological, log, collapsed)
* layout (all in 1 line or separated by category)

So it's good to easily preview your data in a variety of cool ways.
However, it lacks features for customizing your chart to look polished.

It can export the current canvas as a PNG or SVG, or export the series of scenes as an animated GIF or as a JSON Blob (.cdc extension).


#### microbio.csv

I created microbio.csv by researching the history of microbiology.
Some of the dates for events varied, depending upon what source I read.


#### To create the chart:
1) Go to https://timelinestoryteller.com/app
2) Upload microbio.csv
3) Select "Linear" for "Timeline representation"
4) Select "Chronological" for "Scale"
5) Select "Segmented" for "Layout"
6) Click on each event (the red square with the triangle) 
   so that your event text appears and position it where you want it to go
7) Add title by creating an annotation.
8) "Record" the scene to save it.
