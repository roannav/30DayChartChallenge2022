This file includes data on the 1,923 districts in the United States that had alternative schools during 2013-14 school year. All data is for the 2013-14 school year unless otherwise noted.

The file was created by ProPublica, combining and summarizing several publicly available school-level data sets. The federal data used in our analysis relies on reports from states, which in turn often rely on reports from school districts. While the federal data collection 
efforts include some verification and data cleaning, the data is only as accurate as states’ record-keeping and reporting allows.

In preparing the data for analysis, we made two key decisions:

1. Identifying alternative schools 
We identified alternative schools using a school type classification from the Common Core of Data (CCD), compiled by the U.S. Department of Education’s National Center for Education Statistics, with a few modifications: We excluded juvenile justice schools, identified by keywords such as ‘juvenile justice’ and ‘prison’ in the school or district name. We also excluded schools from state and federally operated institutions that serve special-needs populations and excluded schools operated under very unusual oversight structures. In the small percentage of cases where districts indicated a school was both a magnet school and an alternative school, we left the data as reported. We excluded elementary schools. About 95 percent of the schools we considered alternative schools served high school grades. For national analyses, no further adjustments were made. But for analyses of Orange County Public Schools in Florida, alternative school designations were adjusted to reflect additional reporting by ProPublica. District-specific figures included in our visualization, lookup, and data store file (district.2017.03.15.csv) were adjusted based on additional reporting, as indicated.

2. Charter schools 
Most schools in the country are operated by a traditional school district, which draws students from within a geographic catchment area. But some charter schools are authorized under their own administrative agency or under an agency other than a regular, local school district. We reassigned such schools to the district where they are located geographically, to better capture the number of total and alternative students in each district. The reassignment was done using a geographic crosswalk provided by the Stanford Education Data Archive. We only reassigned charter schools, with the exception of New York City Department of Education schools, which were coded under several different districts in the CCD data, but were combined using the SEDA crosswalk.


**Limitations**
Some states and districts operate alternative programs within regular schools, as opposed to stand-alone alternative schools. These programs are not tracked in federal data sources and are not included in our analysis.

The federal data used in our analysis relies on reports from states, which in turn often rely on reports from school districts. While the federal data collection efforts include some verification and data cleaning, the data is generally only as accurate as states’ record-keeping and reporting allows. We’ve noticed that occasionally the CCD alternative school designation is incorrect. Due to the size of the dataset, it cannot be manually corrected and is therefore used as-is.

Some charter schools are not authorized under a traditional school district, and are instead authorized under their own administrative agency or under an agency other than a regular, local school district. We reassigned such schools to the district where they are located geographically, to better capture the number of total and alternative students in each district. This is imperfect: A charter school may draw students from several traditional school districts, but will be assigned to only one geographic school district, based on where the school is located. The reassignment of charter schools into geographic school districts means that student counts and other measures in this data may not match a district’s own accountability data.

ProPublica used this data in our reporting on Alternative Schools. We designed a map and searchable app with the data that allowed users to look up their district, and we wrote a story about the national alternative school landscape.
